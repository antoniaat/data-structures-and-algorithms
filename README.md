 Simple data structures and algorithms implementations in JavaScript.

# Algorithms

## Sorting Algorithms

* **Bubble sort** - ðŸš€ **O (n2)** - In bubble sort, we're going to loop through the array and compare each index with the index next to it. If the those two numbers are out of order (the lesser index's value is greater than the greater index's value) we swap those two numbers' places in the array. We keep looping over that array until everything is in place and nothing was swapped during the last iteration.

* **Insetion sort** - ðŸš€ **O (n2)** - We're going to start at the beginning of the list and assume we have a sorted list of length 1 where the first element is only sorted element. We're then going to grab the second element, and insert it into the correct spot in our sorted list, either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger than our first element. We now have a sorted list of length 2. We then continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the list as the unsorted side dwindles.

* **Merge sort** - ðŸš€ **O(n log n)** - The basic gist of merge sort is that you're going to take your big list, and first divide down in two half size lists and recursively call merge sort on those smaller list, which in turn will do the same. The base case is when you have a list of one, at which point you will return that sorted list of one. On the way up the recursive calls, you will merge those sorted lists together (preferably by another merge function you'll write) that walks through both lists simultaneously and inserts the smaller value first, effectively creating a bigger sorted list.

* **Quick sort** - ðŸš€ **O(n log n)** - The basic gist is that you take the last element in the list and call that the pivot. Everything that's smaller than the pivot gets put into a "left" list and everything that's greater get's put in a "right" list. You then call quick sort on the left and right lists independently (hence the recursion.) After those two sorts come back, you concatenate the sorted left list, the pivot, and then the right list (in that order.) The base case is when you have a list of length 1 or 0, where you just return the list given to you.

# Data Structures

* ðŸš€ **Array List** - ArrayList is done by directly interacting with an allocated piece of memory. You then interact with that allocated piece of memory by addressing the specific indices in the array. In other words, you just treat it like a normal array. However things get a bit more complicated when deleting items from an ArrayList: you have to collapse the list down to the spot where you deleted.

* ðŸš€ **Linked List** -  LinkedList is made of a bunch of nodes that point to the next one in the list. Every node in a LinkedLists has two properties, the value of whatever is being store and a pointer to the next node in the list.

LinkedLists have their ups and downs. On one hand, adding and removing is a breeze: you just have the change the next pointer on the previous node and that's it. Getting is a pain though: if .get is called you have to loop through the nodes until you get to the right node. And that's the tradeoff between LinkedList and ArrayList: LinkedList's adds and deletes are O(1) but the gets are O(n); ArrayList's adds and deletes are O(n) but the gets are O(1).
