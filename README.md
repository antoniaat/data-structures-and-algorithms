# Algorithms

 Simple data structures and algorithms implementations in JavaScript.

## Sorting Algorithms

* **Bubble sort** - ðŸš€ **O (n2)** - In bubble sort, we're going to loop through the array and compare each index with the index next to it. If the those two numbers are out of order (the lesser index's value is greater than the greater index's value) we swap those two numbers' places in the array. We keep looping over that array until everything is in place and nothing was swapped during the last iteration.

* **Insetion sort** - ðŸš€ **O (n2)** - We're going to start at the beginning of the list and assume we have a sorted list of length 1 where the first element is only sorted element. We're then going to grab the second element, and insert it into the correct spot in our sorted list, either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger than our first element. We now have a sorted list of length 2. We then continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the list as the unsorted side dwindles.

* **Merge sort** - ðŸš€ **O(n log n)** - The basic gist of merge sort is that you're going to take your big list, and first divide down in two half size lists and recursively call merge sort on those smaller list, which in turn will do the same. The base case is when you have a list of one, at which point you will return that sorted list of one. On the way up the recursive calls, you will merge those sorted lists together (preferably by another merge function you'll write) that walks through both lists simultaneously and inserts the smaller value first, effectively creating a bigger sorted list.
